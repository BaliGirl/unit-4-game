<p><li>This is a guessing game using numbers where the player will guess with numbers.</li></p>
<p><li>There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.</li></p>
<p><li>The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.</li></p>
<p><li>When the player clicks on a crystal it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.</li></p>
<p><li>The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.</li></p>
<p><li>The amount of points each crystal adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked.</li></p>
<p><li>The number of games won and lost will be displayed.</li></p>
